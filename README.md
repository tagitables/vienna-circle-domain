# Vienna Circle–themed philosophy domain

> **Where meaning begins with structure.**

This is a minimal static site intended for **GitHub Pages**.

## Quick start (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new repo named **<your-username>.github.io**
2. Upload the contents of this folder to the repo root
3. In GitHub: **Settings → Pages**
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main** (root)
4. Wait for Pages to build — your site will appear at:
   - `https://<your-username>.github.io/`

## Custom domain (optional)
- Put your domain into the `CNAME` file (already included as `CNAME.example`).
- Rename `CNAME.example` → `CNAME`.
- In GitHub Pages settings, set the Custom domain.
- Then configure DNS at your domain provider (typically an A record or CNAME).

## Editing
- Homepage: `index.html`
- Styles: `styles.css`
- Notes: add pages under `/notes` and link them from the homepage.
